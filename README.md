# Bython Preprocessor

## To run the typescript/javascript file
To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```
You can then make these into executable by using something like ```pkg index.js --targets node18-win-x64 --output <name>.exe``` 

## Using executables
If you really trust me, you can directly download the executables.
Pro tip: never ever ever download executables and run them unless you trust the publisher!!



This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.17. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
